# Self_project_for learning INFOSEC

### Natas And BurpeSuite
It contains my progress for task4 under pclub_recruitment

- First I started with overthewire tutorials 'bandit' and 'natas' to make myself used to LINUX commands and introduce myself to Infosec.

- Then read about sockets,telnet and buffer overflow . However I was not able to use the first two in the process .I tried to used buffer overflow in text box of chat moderation section because it was not able to hold more than 1000 characters

- Since I had done natas, I was able to use burp suite to get into Hackers Panel but after this I was stuck.
