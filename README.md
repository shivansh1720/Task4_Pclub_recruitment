# Task4_Pclub_recruitment
It contains my progress for task4 under pclub_recruitment

- First I started with overthewire tutorials 'bandit' and 'natas' to make myself used to LINUX commands and introduce myself to Infosec.

- Then read about sockets,telnet and buffer overflow . However I was not able to use the first two in the process .I tried to used buffer overflow in text box of chat moderation section because it was not able to hold more than 1000 characters

- Since I had done natas, I was able to use burp suite to get into Hackers Panel but after this I was stuck.

- I also tried to get shell access from terminal but it was not helpful as I couldnot get ssh private key for the server

#### I request you to consider my progress because I spent more than two days on it. Whether or not I was able to complete the task, still my knowledge about infosec incresed by folds from what it was earlier.
